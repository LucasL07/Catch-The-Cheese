# Catch-The-Cheese
catch the cheese game.

this project was designed by 2 lovely girls, and without their art and design, Catch The Cheese would have never come to exist.

i only helped bring it to life with code in the godot engine.

this was the first ever real video game i made from the ground-up and i feel really proud about it.

i'm sure they feel really proud about it too. 

this is not the type of game that will change anyone's life,

it's just a 5-minute platforming puzzle game with janky controls.

but for me it's something much more than that.


so whoever's reading this, i hope you can play this game, and know that this little game was a huge part of what i am today.


i hope you can appreciate that. 


even if it doesn't change your life at all. 


i write this strange and short letter hoping that you can find some meaning 


among the hot stoves and falling soda cans,


and maybe catching the cheese at the end will mean something to you, as it does to me 


but what do i know? i just like cute rats. and cheese
